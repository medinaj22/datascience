# datascience
Greetings!

My name is Isaiah Medina and I am a member of the Washington and Lee University CO'22. I majored in biology while minoring in data science. For my data science minor, a portfolio showing various work and projects I had undergone while a student was required. In this porfolio, you will find a variety of projects and the languages which were used. Languages include R, Python, SQL and Excel. Through this portfolio you will hopefully see my development in these langauges as well as use this to gauge whether or not I have mastered the material taught.

If you have any questions about these works or projects please feel free to reach out to either my email or phone number. Thanks in advance!
