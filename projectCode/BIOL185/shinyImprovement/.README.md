For the improvement in my portfolio, I decided to improve on the information I used to create a Shiny app exploring inequality in the States. 
For this part, I decided to look at education attainment in Virginia between White and Black citizens in Virginia counties. I completed this in Python instead of R as Python
is the most recent language I learned and still fresh in my mind. I also did not add it to my Shiny app do to have problems integrating Python into R with a package created by R developers.
Due to the dataset being very large and GitHub having a limit on the size of files uploaded, I have uploaded the file to Box and included a link for access.
