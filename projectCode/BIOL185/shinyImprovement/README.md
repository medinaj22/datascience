For the improvement in my portfolio, I decided to improve on the information I used to create a Shiny app exploring inequality in the States. 
For this part, I decided to look at education attainment in Virginia between White and Black citizens in Virginia counties. I completed this in Python instead of R as Python
is the most recent language I learned and still fresh in my mind. I also did not add it to my Shiny app do to have problems integrating Python into R with a package created by R developers.
Due to the dataset being very large and GitHub having a limit on the size of files uploaded, I have uploaded the file to Box and included a link for access.

NOTE: If using Google Colab, there may be issues as certain packages are not installed ans should be installed using either pip or conda. Check with your IT department to find out which packages must be installed. I used Anaconda meaning the packages I needed were already installed.
